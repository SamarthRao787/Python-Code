# Python-Code
# The Python code I am uploading is related to a project I worked on that involves instacart data.
# The context is that Instacart wanted to uncover more patterns and data regarding their sales data.
# I used Python and sales data provided by Instacart to conduct an exploratory analysis to uncover insights.
# Through the analysis, I uncovered several insights that Instacart can use to implement data driven solutions to improve their sales.
# For Task 4.3 I imported the instacart data sets and conducted some basic data exploration to get a better perspective on the data.
# For Task 4.4 I used wrangling procedures to make factors in the data set more consistent so that it would be easier to work with.
# For Task 4.5 I did additional data consistency checks to address factors like mixed data, missing values, and duplicates.
# For Task 4.6 I merged the instacart orders and products data sets to have a greater capability of analysis.
# For Task 4.7 I created new columns based on flags I established for specific sets of paramaters.
# For Task 4.8 I used data aggregation functions to generate descriptive statistics about customer information.
# For Task 4.9 parts 1 & 2 I generated visualizations for my analysis. 
# For Task 4.10 I used the visualization techniques to answer stakeholder questions.
